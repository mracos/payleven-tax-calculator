# payleven-tax-calculator

> PWA calculator for the payleven taxes
It calculates how much you need to charge to receive the right amount (AKA, make your client pay the taxes (: )

- Configured with babel and eslint :)
- Using [keen-ui](https://github.com/JosephusPaye/Keen-UI)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies and serve it on localhost:8080
yarn && yarn dev
```

### TODO
- [ ] better UI
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] add manifest.json so it works offline
- [ ] make optional the "client pays the taxes" feature
